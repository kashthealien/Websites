                I am Kashyap R Puranik a senior undergraduate student from the Computer Science Department of IIT Madras. I wish to apply for the MS program at the Computer Science Department of Stanford with Artificial Intelligence as my interest.<br/><br/>

                Ever since I started playing computer games when I was young, I have been quite fascinated by advances in technology that have helped to make a computer think and reason like a human and probably outperform humans. Out of interest, I made simple games with look aheads, adapting to the player's mode of playing, by observation. My interest in Computer Science deepened in my high school because of the Computer Science courses that I chose to take. The formal education helped me shape my dreams getting an idea of what was in the field. After highschool I got an all India rank of 237 in the Joint Engineering Examination taken by over 200,000 students. Indian Institute of Technology Madras being one of the best colleges in India for its technological innovation was an obvious choice for me to pursue my undergraduate education.<br/><br/>

                I developed my enthusiasm further after the completion of my core undergraduate computer science courses like Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Organisation, Database Systems and so on in my sophomore and junior years. I like problem solving a lot and got involved in solving algorithmic problems at the places like the Sphere Online Judge and Project Euler. I also did web-development work and I have created websites for organisations and festivals in my institute. My interest in Computer Science and my problem solving ability led me to get involved and win in many Computer Science based competitions like Simulation Championship, Code Obfuscation, Industry Defined Problems etc. at national technical festivals like Shaastra. I also got into open source development and got selected in the Google Summer of Code program in the year 2009.<br/><br/>

                It was in my junior year I chose Introduction to Artificial Intelligence as an elective out of interest. I was introduced to a wide range of concepts that totally inspired me to take up more subjects in the field. I went on to do more courses like Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Probabilistic Reasoning, Data Mining and Natural Language Processing. I am planning to do a few more courses like Planning and Constraint Satisfaction, Memory based Reasoning and Kernel Methods for Pattern Analysis next semester. The assignments and projects that I have done in these courses have motivated me to learn more in these fields.<br/><br/>

                I did my Summer Internship project at Google Bangalore which involved Sentiment Analysis of Google News articles. I used the concept of Sentiment Composition (referring to the papers by Choi and Cardi 2008 and POLART) to get better accuracy and precision into the system which works better than the naive bag of words method. In my Natural Language Processing course, I am working on a project which involves domain independent automatic detection of attribute-value pairs from sentences. For my final year project, I am working on a project which does automatic insertion of hyperlinks in text (Agosti Crestani Melucci). All the projects I have been working on mostly involve Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning concepts. I have hence developed deep interest in these fields and want to gain greater insight into them. These projects have made me realise that the problems at hand are not easy and can get pretty complicated at times. I would hence like to get better insight to face the challenges.<br/><br/>

                My aim is to gain expertise in the field of Artificial Intelligence for which I want to do a masters in this field. I am specifically interested in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Information Extraction and Information Retrieval. I have a branch position of 3 with a CGPA of 9.4 in my Computer Science courses and a CGPA of 9.14 overall. All the work I have done in my projects at Google and in IITM have influenced me to pursue higher education to get a Masters degree in Computer Science. My long term goal is to be an innovator/researcher in technology in my field. I want to be able to make significant contributions to extend the frontiers of the capabilities of today's technology.<br/><br/>
                 
                During the course of my projects, I have used tools created by the Stanford NLP group like the Stanford parser and Stanford NER. I was amazed by the various projects that the NLP group has undertaken like NatLog which involves KRR and NLP which are of interest to me and the personalised page rank algorithms project which has such a huge impact on the world. I want to be able to work with people who are involved in such amazing projects. The state of the art research facilities and the distinguished faculty have strengthen my desire to apply to Stanford University for a masters degree. I strongly feel that I will be able to deliver my objectives as a student.<br/><br/>
