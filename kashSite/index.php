                <h2><span>Welcome to my home page</span></h2>
                <p>Hi! I am Kashyap R Puranik, a senior year <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in">Computer Science</a> student from the <a href="http://www.iitm.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a>. Welcome to my personal home page.</p>
                <p>My hometown is the city of Bangalore and my mother tongue is Kannada. I did my primary schooling at Prathibha Bala Mandira[2002], my high schooling at Vijaya High School[2005] and got my pre-university degree at the Kumarans College[2007], all in the city of Bangalore.</p>
                <p>I love problem solving and I generally pick up and solve algorithmic problems at <a href="http://www.spoj.pl/users/kashthealien">SPOJ</a>. I also like web-operations work and I have been involved in the construction of websites like <a href="http://www.exebit.org">Exebit, the CSE IITM Department Festival</a>, <a href="http://www.cfi.iitm.ac.in">Centre for Innovation, IIT Madras</a>, <a href="http://www.saarang.org/2009/">Saarang 2009</a>. Being a KDE/Plasma developer, I did a <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">GSOC project</a> in <a href="http://edu.kde.org/kalzium/">Kalzium</a> under the organisation <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> in the summer 2009. I interned in Google Bangalore in the Summer of 2010 under Aman Gupta in the Google News team. My project was  titled 'Sentiment Analysis in Google News Articles'. I have won several competitions in the annual technical festival of IIT Madras <a href="http://www.shaastra.org">Shaastra</a> and <a href="www.exebit.org">Exebit</a> which include events like Simulation Championship, Industry Relavent Problems, Code Obfuscation Contest and IgNobel Prizes to name a few. I have a <a href="http://www.kashthealien.wordpress.com">technical blog</a> where I post my tech exploits.</p>
                <p>My interests lie in the field of Artificial Inteligence. I have chosen most of my elective courses in this field. You can find some of my academic projects in the <a href="./projects/php">projects</a> page. I am currently doing my BTech Project under Dr Sutanu Chakraborti. The project involves automatic insertion of hypertext in documents.</p>
                <p>Other than academics, I love light-classical Indian/Indian-filmy music (A.R Rehman, Shankar Ehsaan Loy etc). My hobbies include playing the keyboard, I have a Yamaha PSR S500 keyboard. I am an animal lover/nature lover. I have a blog called <a href="http://kashyapPuranik.co.cc/green">green</a> where I try to post little known facts and policies one can take up to save the nature. I have another <a href="http://www.sarkashtica.blogspot.com">humour-blog</a> involving my life at and outside IITM.</p>
